# Facial Expression Recognition
The project is designed to utilize the Qualcomm Neural Processing SDK, a deep learning software from Qualcomm Snapdragon Platforms for Facial Expression Recognition in Android platform. The Android Application uses built-in/connected camera to capture the preview of Human Face and uses Machine Learning model to get the prediction/inference of facial expression.

## Pre-requisites
* Before starting the Android application, please follow the instructions for setting up neural network SDK using the link provided below.
   https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/setup.html
* Android device 6.0 and above which uses below mentioned Snapdragon processors/Snapdragon HDK with display can be used to test the application

## List of Supported Snapdragon Devices

## How does it work?
The application opens a camera preview(restricted only for front camera), collects all the frames, detects faces present in the frames, crops the face and converts it to bitmap. The network is built via Neural Network builder by passing model file in dlc format as the input. The face bitmap is then given to model for inference, which returns expression of captured faces.
## Steps to Install and Run the Application

* Firstly set up the hardware as shown above in the Hardware Setup section
* Power on the Snapdragon HDK board
* Connect the Dev-Board/Android phone via usb to the device
* Switch on the display and choose the USB connection option to File Transfer
* Check if adb is installed in the windows/linux device, if not follow the below instructions in the below link to install
   https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html.
* Use the below command to install the apk the connected device with help of adb. [Download APK(Debug)](./android-app/Output/app-debug.apk)
   $ adb install app-debug.apk
* Search the Facial Expression Recognition app in the app menu and launch the application
